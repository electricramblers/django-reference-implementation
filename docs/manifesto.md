**Disclaimer:** This is a learning exercise for myself, and I wanted to
solicit feedback from the community here.

I imagine that many of us start projects with a fair bit of energy only to lose
steam after a few days or weeks. Github is littered with the shells of
well-intentioned projects that never really bared fruit. Life happens, and
"humans are gonna human," so there is no shame in it.

I've been guilty of it for sure. But, maybe--just maybe--I'm able to change that.

## The idea is simple (but execution is hard):
- Strive to make this repo 1% better every day and let the improvements compound
over time.
- Play the long-game and turn it into a viable, useful project.
- Establish good habits any life-long developer should have (thats me).

## PERSONAL GOALS
- I will use this repo to not only improve the code but also setup a healthy
open-source project using best practices from GitHub and the broader community.
- I will improve my skills as an open source developer/maintainer, developing
deeper skills with async comms, distributed development, and being a benevolent
dictator.
- I will become even better at breaking down complex and risky changes into
units of work that I can deliver in small chunks, safely.
- I will make QA/Testing a 1st class citizen and will be part of my 1% deliveries
- I will use this repo as the baseline for testing new business ideas and learning
new technologies (eg LLMs, Blockchain, etc)

## RISKS
- Over time things become more feature complete and we slow the rate of improvement
